Elliot Cobb

I collaborated with Lila Ramani

I spent 3 hours on this

It is not possible to get data from the mbta json url because they block random urls from requesting the data with xmlhttp for security purposes.

I got a "Origin 'http://elliotcobb.github.io' is therefore not allowed access." error when I requested data from my private github site. I also got one when I requested it from the null origin "file:///"
