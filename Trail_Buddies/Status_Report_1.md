Status Report #1

1) This week, we worked on the design of the site, focusing on the css file,
        as well as cleaning up some of the html code to meet w3c standards

2) We realize that this was a relatively light week, so we didn't run into any
        big issues while doing our edits.

3) With more time available to us next week, we are hoping to get a large
        chunk of the javascript done, such as
                - creating an XMLHttprequest
                - parsing the JSON
                - make google maps markers for each hike in the JSON file

1. " creating an XMLHttprequest" --at this point, use jQuery for XHR stuff including pulling JSON data (e.g., $.json())
